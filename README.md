# Advanced Who's in the News
Check out the [demo running on Bluemix](http://whos-in-the-news-advanced.mybluemix.net) to experience what you can build.

This code base builds off the original source at ["Who's in the News" by Zach Walchuk](https://developer.ibm.com/watson/blog/2015/05/11/whos-in-the-news-an-alchemydata-news-application/).  We still use the majority of Zach's code to obtain the latest new from AlchemyData News.  But we now provide users a quick drop down of to filter by Alchemy-defined entity or subentity.

### Getting Started
Once you have the files, enter your API key in newsApp.py under the API_KEY variable. To kick things off:

```
cd whos-in-the-news
python newsApp.py
```

After that, access the application locally at port 8000: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
